Design Information:

Initial Design Informaiton:
	Mount Point Bytes used
	To DO:
	XGet File Path
	XGet Sub Directories
	-take sub directory list and store it
	-Get Sub directories into dictionary by creating a tuple of original path and sub directory index in list
	-create open variable that joins the dictionary at every index to test
	-Look up directories bassed on dictionary
	-create json file for storing
	-pull data from each sub directory on their byte size
	-put the combined dictionary variable and data size into json
	-Display the Json data

	Need error correction if file is not a mount point, not accessable, not a path in general etc...
	Might need to walk through each file in path and calculate teh combined size of all files in path at given
	directory

	Set up
	- imports
	*Json to display end data in a json file
	*os to manipulate file information
	*shutil to get file data

	*Files variable will be a dict

	First step
	- Check if given point is a mount point
	- using os.path.ismount() method
	- Path should be input()
		* Make path an independent variable instead of just common input in the even you need multiple paths later for sub path
	- 


	Steps
	1. import needed 
	Mount Point Bytes used

Second Version Design:
	To DO:
	XGet File Path
	XGet Sub Directories
	Xtake sub directory list and store it
	XGet Sub directories into dictionary by creating a tuple of original path and sub directory index in list
	Xcreate open variable that joins the dictionary at every index to test
	XLook up directories bassed on dictionary
	Xcreate json file for storing
	Xpull data from each sub directory on their byte size
	Xput the combined dictionary variable and data size into json
	XDisplay the Json data


	Need error correction if file is not a mount point, not accessable, not a path in general etc...
	

	Set up:
	- imports
	*Json to display end data in a json file
	*os to manipulate file information
	*Pathlib to manipulate file path to correct operating system slash work

	*Files variable will be a dict

	Steps:
	- Check if given point is a mount point
	- using os.path.ismount() method
	- Path should be input()
	- Make second pathData varialbe to store path as a Pathlib data type
	* Make path an independent variable instead of just common input in the even you need multiple paths later for sub path
	- Create a Result dictionary to store the mount path and coresponding file names as a paired set
	- Create a Sub Directory list to show each item one directory level down
	- Using a while loop to go through the sub directories and get the file size
	- Using nested for loop to make sure the sub directory is a file and not a folder
	- Serialize Json and add dictionary that uses plain data and not operating system version from Pathlib to display later
	- Add Dictionary and byte data informaiotn to Json and call back the Json to display	
	
 
	Updates
	V2:	
	-Added Pathlib to make file system correct based on operating system since a window os uses \ and unix uses/
	its important to allow both os's to run the script for any enviornment
	-Added Json Format to display data as asked

Third Version Design:
	Added ability to loop back through code with recursion and make sure that if you wanted to check other mount points you can.
