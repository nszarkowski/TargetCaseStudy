To Scale this project what other functions need to be added:
1. Ability to get folders as well as files to know how much data the folder stores since currently only files come up
    a. possiblity is to create an os.walk function where you get the files within folders byte data and add them all together to create folder byte instead of 0
       since folder has no data but, a file in the folder does. 
    b. The challenge will be resource management since going through a folder for byte data means going 
       into every sub-folder to get said byte data
    c. other challenge will be storing every new byte data for math and making sure you don't count the same data twice going up and down the directory
2. Allow for recursion in order to re-start program if you enter an incorrect mount point.
*added to version 3
3. Go through all possible mount points user can acess and create an option for them to pick from instead of trying to remember every mount point
    a. difficulty would be having permisions to access all mount points
    b. would need to create a dropdown like system where user selects from a pre-determined set of answers
